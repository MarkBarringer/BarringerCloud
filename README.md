# BarringerCloud
Barringer.org Cloud Project

Barringer.org is a traditional data center hosted enviroment since 1995.  We are currently working on transitioning this to a cloud based enviroment, which will require some custom code to allow for authentication, data reporting and user management as well as other services.  As we develop this code we will be using this repository for the purpose of checking in and distribution.

Many thanks to the folks at https://www.montastic.com/ for our web monitoring and service all these years!
